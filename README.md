# hello-world
Hello world! Let's hope I'm good at this programming stuff/
I've learned HTML, CSS, JAVA, C, PYTHON, and RUBY -- on codecademy and in class at UVic.
OK I've been at this for a couple hours now, I know how to do repositories and push/pull stuff now but I don't know what I'm doing here.
